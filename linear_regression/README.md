# 📊 Linear Regression – E-Commerce Dataset

This project demonstrates a simple Linear Regression model using an **E-Commerce customer dataset**. The goal is to predict a customer’s **Yearly Amount Spent** based on features like time spent on the website, mobile app usage, session length, and more.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To build and evaluate a linear regression model that helps an e-commerce business understand which factors most influence customer spending.

## 📁 Files

- `Linear_Regression_E_Commerce_Dataset.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- `ecommerce_customers.csv`: Dataset used (make sure to include this if you're uploading it too).

---

## 🔍 Steps Covered

- Data loading and exploration
- Visualizations (Seaborn/Matplotlib)
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Model training (LinearRegression from `sklearn`)
- Model evaluation using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Residual analysis

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Linear regression is a good baseline model for continuous variable prediction.
- Proper visualization and feature correlation help in better model interpretation.
- Evaluation metrics show how well the model performs and help identify overfitting/underfitting.
